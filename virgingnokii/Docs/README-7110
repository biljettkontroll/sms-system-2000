-- Notes, bugs and a todo list for the 7110 series --

* Notes *

Another Nokia phones series, another protocol. These phones seems to be the
most popular at the moment, but probably for not more the one year more.
Anyway the support for them is quite complete, but not complete yet. We hope
to finish soon.

Phones supported by this driver so far are:
 * 7110
 * 6210
 * 6250
 * 7190
Probably also other phones will work with them. If you know such model,
please let us know.

This driver was tested and is known to work with DAU-9P and DLR-3[P] cables
and IrDA connection. As the side note, remember that to get the faster
initialization with DAU-9P cable use 'connection = dau9p' instead of
'connection = serial' in the config file. For IrDA use 'connection = irda',
not 'connection = infrared'.

Hint: For all these phones you can also use AT driver, as they all have a
builtin hardware modem, which may give you more functionality for the
moment.

* Bugs *

 * Probably there are some ;-)

* TODO *

 * documentation
 * implement all functionality
