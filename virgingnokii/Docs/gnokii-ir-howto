  1.4.  Latest version of this document

  You can find the latest version of this document in the gnokii-
  distribution under: http://www.gnokii.org/ or in the web on
  http://www.dev-thomynet.de/nokworld/gnokii-infrared-howto/ .


  2.  Introduction

  Gnokii is a suite of programs what deal with some mobilephones from
  NOKIA (http://www.nokia.com ).

  This document is the guide to use gnokii over infrared.  It is not the
  general gnokii-userguide and contains no part of protocol.  This document
  covers only Nokia 6110, Nokia 6130 and Nokia 6150 models, as they have
  own IrDA stack, that is incompatible with standard stacks on various
  operating systems.


  3.  Installation

  You can get gnokii from gnokiis-homepage:

  o  http://www.gnokii.org/

  Gnokii-package is available in some different formats: rpm and tgz.
  To install the tgz unpack the package with

  tar xvzf filename


  The first address after unpack is file README in dir gnokii - all
  important parts you can read in it.


  3.1.  What Gnokii needs for communication over infrared

  For a long time gnokii contains everything that you need in software
  for infrared-communication.

  On the other side you need some hardware:

  1. Nokia mobile phone with infrared-port.  The phone models are: 6110,
     6130, 6150

  2. Infrared-port on your pc or notebook.  In moment only SIR works
     with gnokii, because phones are limited to 115200 bps.


  3.2.  Installing and Configuring the Software

  All steps needed to install and configure gnokii are described in
  README.  Here is the short way for configure infrared with gnokii:


  1. Copy the file sample/gnokiirc to your homedir.

       mkdir -p ~/.config/gnokii
       cp Docs/sample/gnokiirc ~/.config/gnokii/config




  2. Edit the config file:


       port       = /dev/ttyS1 # Set this to the port where you infrared-equipment is connected.
       model      = 6150       # Set up to your model.
       connection = infrared   # If you want connection over cable set this to serial.




  3. Make the complete gnokii-software with make in gnokii-dir.

  Thats all! If you use infrared in the config all parts of the gnokii-
  distribution use communication over infrared! This parts are in
  moment:

  1. gnokii

  2. xgnokii

  3. gnokiid

  4. smsd

  5. gnocky (which is not a part of gnokii distribution)

  Also any other third party software using libgnokii can do it.


  4.  Mobiles and their software-version

  In all tested situations the software from your phone is not the
  problem if you can't connect it over infrared. The problem in such
  situations was the pc-equipment or the pc-configuration. If you have
  problems please look first in ``pc-section''.


  4.1.  Get software-version of your phone

  To get the software-version from your phone press in idle-mode:

       *#0000#

  or

       *#9999#


  4.2.  Tested phone-software-version


  1. 6110

  o  V 4.73, 22-04-98, NSE-3

  o  V 5.24, 14-09-98, NSE-3

  2. 6130

  o  V 4.11, 10-06-98, NSK-3

  2. 6150

  o  V 4.01, 23-09-98, NSM-1

  o  V 4.12, 02-12-98, NSM-1

  o  V 5.02, 02-02-99, NSM-1


  5.  PC-Hardware and Configuration

  This is the most cause for some problems. In moment gnokii works only
  with SIR- equipment and not with FIR-eqipment. One reason for this is,
  what phone-speed is limited to 115200 bps.  If you have any problems
  with your equipment read the following parts. Adapters can be the
  following:

  o  Internal Adapters

    +  Serial Adapters

       -  SIR

       -  FIR

    +  Parallel Adapters

       -  SIR

       -  FIR

  o  External Adapters

    +  Serial Adapters (including USB adapters)

       -  SIR

       -  FIR

    +  USB Adapters

       -  SIR

       -  FIR

    +  Parallel Adapters

       -  SIR

       -  FIR

  Mosts laptops have an internal infrared-port. Some motherboards - ASUS
  for example - have also a infrared-connector. On this boards you must
  buy a little infrared-transmitter to use infrared-connections.

  It is very difficult to describe all parts of configuration. On this
  reason this HowTo list all tested laptops and other hardware in each
  section.

  Note that probably only internal adapters and serial adapters will work in
  the described configurations in this HOWTO.

  o  BIOS-Menu     : System Devices: Infrared Port: Customized: SIR,
     2F8, IRQ3

  o  Configuration : In BIOS you can configure many thinks for the
     internal-infrared-port.  First you have some choices: SIR or FIR or
     AUTO. All kinds are tested and works - also FIR!  For the COM-Port
     you must set address in hex and irq. For FIR and AUTO you must also
     DMA.  If you have problems with address/irq look in ``COM-PORT-
     Table''.  Tested with all possibillity com-port from 1 to 4 and
     their default irqs - no problems. DMA was set in all test to: 3.

  6.  Gnokii over infrared versus LINUX-IRDA

  You can not use gnokii over infrared and linux-irda at the same time.
  If you want use gnokiis ir-communication you must put linux-irda off.
  If you want use linux-irda you must close all gnokii-applications what
  use the infrared-port in moment. Note, that this applies only against
  Nokia 6110, Nokia 6130 and Nokia 6150 mobile phones.


  7.  FAQ

  No FAQ is available in moment.


  8.  Appendix A: COM-Port-Table

  Here you find the default addresses and irq's from com1 up to com4 -
  or ttyS0 up to ttyS3.


  o  ttyS0: 0x3F8, IRQ: 4, COM1

  o  ttyS1: 0x2F8, IRQ: 3, COM2
