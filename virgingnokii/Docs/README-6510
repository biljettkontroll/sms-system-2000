-- Notes, bugs and a todo list for the 6510 series --

* Notes *

First of all, tested with this driver so far are:
 * 6510
 * 8310
 * 6310
 * 6310i
 * 6360
 * 6610
 * 6100
 * 5100
 * 3510
 * 3510i
 * 3595
 * 6800
 * 6810
 * 6820
 * 6820b
 * 6610i
 * 6230
 * 6650
 * 7210
 * 7250
 * 7250i
 * 7600
 * 6170
 * 6020
 * 6230i
All Nokia Series40 phones should work with this driver.

Code for the 6510 phones has been tested with DAU-9P and DLR-3P cables and
IrDA connection. The following conection type values are recommended for the
various connection media:

-----------------------------------------
| Media		| Connection type	|
|---------------------------------------|
| dau9p		| dau9p or serial	|
| dlr3p		| dlr3p			|
| IrDA		| irda			|
| Bluetooth	| bluetooth		|
| USB		| dku2libusb or phonet	|
-----------------------------------------
When you don't know what your cable is you can first try serial value.

The current code is able to:
 * identify the phone ;-)
 * read/write phonebook entries
 * read SMS messages of all kinds
 * read SMS centers
 * send basic text messages
 * read/write calendar entries
 * read the memory status
 * read/write bitmaps (group, operator logos)
 * read network info
 * read RF/battery level
 * read date/time
 * read list of ringtones
 * read/write profiles
 * read WAP bookmarks/settings
 * read/write/delete ToDo entries
 * create/delete SMS folders
 * save SMS messages to phone (may be dangerous)
 * read/delete MMS (only Series 40 3rd Edition)

Hint: For all these phones you can also use AT driver, as they all have a
builtin hardware modem, but it usually supports less commands so it isn't
recommended.

* phonet Driver *

Linux 2.6.28 and later versions provide a network kernel driver called
"phonet" that conflicts with the dku2libusb driver provided by libgnokii and
that can connect to the same phones.
The port value is the device name as seen with "ifconfig", usually usbpn0.
When using this driver you may encounter the following errors:
* "Operation not permitted" - run as root:
  setcap cap_sys_admin,cap_net_raw=+ep $(which gnokii)
* "Address family not supported by protocol" - run "modprobe cdc_phonet" as
  root and remove the cdc_phonet and phonet modules from the blacklist if
  you put them there to use the dku2libusb driver
* "No such device" - the phone isn't connected: choose "Nokia PC Suite" or
  "Nokia mode" from phone's menu
* "No route to host" - run as root "ifconfig usbpn0 up"

* TODO *

 * implement further functionality
