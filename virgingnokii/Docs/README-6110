-- Notes, bugs and a todo list for the 6110 series --

* Notes *

Code for the 6110 phones has been tested with the DAU-9P MBus Cable NSE-3.

Phones of 6110 Series have somewhat different protocol then other Nokia
phones series. More detailes on the protocol you'll find in the
Docs/protocol/nk6110.txt file inside the gnokii sources.

The current code allows you to do almost everything you are able to do with
these phones. It covers SMS, phonebook, calendar operations and much, much
more.

There are some problems with the few firmwares (V 05.24). It
seems that these firmware is weird. If you have a Nokia with this
firmware, it accepts the PIN request (displays Code Accepted message)
but nothing is returned to the PC. The communication is only in
one direction :-( I do not know why. If you can help with this,
please let me know.

* Known Bugs *

- None, we write quality software here... :)

* To-do *

- writing documentation of the protocol

- delete all FIXME from the sources
