           QUICK-START GUIDE TO RLP DATA CALLS USING GNOKII

(1) Compile and install gnokii as per instructions in the INSTALL file.

e.g.

   cd /usr/src
   tar xvfz /tmp/gnokii-0.5.X.tar.gz
   cd gnokii-0.5.X
   ./configure --enable-nls --with-x
   make
   groupadd gnokii
   make install

(2) Create /etc/xdg/gnokii/config or ~/.config/gnokii/config

   mkdir -p /etc/gnokii/config
   cp Docs/sample/gnokiirc /etc/xdg/gnokii/config
   
   or
   
   mkdir -p ~/.config/gnokii
   cp Docs/sample/gnokiirc ~/.config/gnokii/config

   Edit to suit; in my case:

   [global]
   port = /dev/ttyS2
   model = 6150
   initlength = default
   connection = serial
   bindir = /usr/local/sbin/

(3) Connect your phone to your PC and then run gnokiid:

   # gnokiid

   If successful, you should see a message saying that mgnokiidev has been
   run to create /dev/gnokii.  If you're using a 5110/6110 series phone
   you should hear a beep and see an "accessory connected" message on
   the phone.  If you're using a 3810 series phone you won't see anything
   on the phones LCD.

   I run gnokiid as root; it will also work for another user who is
   in group gnokii, as long as the serial port is accessible to that
   user as well.  It's not recommended that you run gnokiid as root
   permanently however - it is better to put yourself in group gnokii


(4) Use /dev/gnokii as a modem:

e.g. ppp session
--------------- /etc/ppp/peers/demon-gnokii ---------------------
/dev/gnokii 115200
modem crtscts defaultroute
connect 'chat -v ABORT BUSY ABORT ERROR ABORT "NO CARRIER" "" AT OK-AT-OK ATD02083389666 CONNECT'
user XXXX.demon.co.uk
noauth
mtu 296
debug
----------------------------------------------------------------

   If you call a computer connected to an ISDN line you can use the V110
   protocol. To use this protocoll you have to put ATS35=0 in your chat
   script. Replace the connect line with the following:

connect 'chat -v TIMEOUT 60 ABORT BUSY ABORT ERROR ABORT "NO CARRIER" "" AT OK ATS35=0 OK ATD0123456789 CONNECT'

   on the computer called you can use the ttyI* device, for more info read
   the following mail:
   http://mail.nongnu.org/archive/html/gnokii-users/2002-07/msg00165.html

--------------- /etc/ppp/pap-secrets ---------------------------
XXXX.demon.co.uk	demon-gnokii	<yourpassword>
----------------------------------------------------------------

    Then "pppd call demon-gnokii" should connect
    ('tail -f /var/log/messages' to see what is happening)

(5) If a call terminates you should get 'NO CARRIER' and gnokiid should
    continue to work, but this is early code and you may find you have to
    Ctrl-C and restart gnokiid (especially if the phone says the terminal
    connection has been lost)
    
(6) As gnokiid is still under development, ensure your data call has
    hung up by checking your phone display at the end of the call.

(7) See also example files in Docs/sample directory.
