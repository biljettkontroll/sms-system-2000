*** Notes, Install, bugs etc for the DKU2 Linux kernel module ***


* Notes *

The recommended way to use DKU2 cable is to use included in gnokii userspace
libusb driver. Ensure that you have libusb on your system (if you compile
gnokii you would need development libusb packages) and use
connection=dku2libusb setting in your config file. As port use number of
compatible USB end-point (starting with 1). This setting is useful just to
distinct more than one DKU2 phone connected to PC.
You may want to install Docs/sample/45-nokiadku2.rules to set device
permissions for non-root users using udev.

Sources for the nokia_dku2 Linux kernel module have been removed since gnokii
0.6.28.
