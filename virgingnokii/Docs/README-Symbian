Most of the modern phones are based on the Symbian OS. These phones have
broken the convention and replaced the traditional FBUS protocol framework
by a new one. The new protocol provides synchronizational functionality, but
the older one was more powerful. This is one of the reasons we decided that
analysis of the new protocol is time wasting. Our plan is to create a
client-server application. The client part is built into libgnokii, the
server part runs on the phone. These communicate with our own protocol.

The client and the server application is tightly coupled, so you have to use
the same version on both side. The source code of the server application
(called gnapplet) is licensed under the GNU GPL, it can be downloaded from
the gnokii cvs. Compiling gnapplet requires special tools, you can look into
gnupoc (http://www.gnupoc.org). Installing the Nokia SDK isn't easy, so we
provide a pre-compiled version. You can find the appropriate version in the
Docs/ directory of the tarball (called gnapplet.sis).

You can install the SIS file in the same way as another symbian application.
You can transfer it to the phone over the OBEX protocol (OBEX is available
over IrDA or Bluetooth or cable connection).

You can use the following settings in your config file to access the phone:

- Bluetooth connection

    [global]
    port = _bluetooth_address_
    rfcomm_channel = 14
    model = symbian
    connection = bluetooth

- IrDA connection

    [global]
    port = /dev/ircomm0
    model = symbian
    connection = irda

- TCP/IP connection (disabled by default, you have to edit gnapplet.ini
    on your phone to enable it)

    [global]
    port = 169.254.1.68:1912	(put the IP address of your phone here)
    model = symbian
    connection = tcp

You have to start gnapplet first (you'll find it in the menu), then start
gnokii or xgnokii. After gnokii disconnects (or you won't connect in 30
seconds), the application will terminate.

The current code is able to:
 * identify the phone
 * read/write/delete phonebook entries
 * read/delete call log (missed, received, dialled calls)
 * read the memory status
 * read network info
 * read RF/battery level
 * read/set clock, read/set alarm
 * read/write/delete calendar entries
 * read/write/delete todo entries
 * send/receive sms

* Bugs *

 * phonebook handling is quite limited:
    o name isn't set or read correctly
    o missing attributes
    o no group handling
    o missing SIM memory handling
 * gnapplet seems to not work on SymbianOS v3 devices (eg. Nokia 5500)

* TODO *

 * implement the missing things :-)
