1. IrDA connection for nk7110 driver (Nokia 6210 and Nokia 7110) is slooow.
Configurations known to be affected:
	model = 6210
	connection = irda
and
	model = 7110
	connection = irda

2. Nokia 6100 with old firmware (04.01 reported) breaks when used with
nk6510 driver. Configurations known to be affected:
	model = 6100
	connection = irda
Hadley Rich reports the same bad behaviour with Nokia 7250i. It is not
supported explicitely but hacking the sources to support it (the usual way)
leads to the damage. It seems that this behaviour affects Nokia Series 40
v1. See http://www.mobile-review.com/forum2/showthread.php?t=10266 for more
complete list. these phones are currently disabled in gnokii when using FBUS
over IrDA communication.
It seems to happen only when using xgnokii. If you don't intend to do it you
may try do remove/disable the blacklisting code in nk6510.c driver.

3. Nokia 6310(i) doesn't work well over the DRL3P cable. After few
successfull connections it stops working. When you power the phone off and
on, it works again. Configuration known to be affected:
	model = 6310
	connection = serial
and
	model = 6310
	connection = dlr3p
[Perhaps it is just my phone/cable]

4. Nokia 6510 series (e.g. 6310) will be silent after gnokii --playringtone.
We don't know how to restore the original settings, so you have to power
cycle your phone. Don't worry, it won't destroy your phone, it's just
annoying.
