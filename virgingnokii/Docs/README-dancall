-- Notes, bugs and a todo list for the Dancall phones --

* Notes *

Dancalls are crappy telephones, commonly found in czech republic. In
bazaar, you can find good phones on one table, bad phones on another
table, and dancalls in nearby trashcan. Dancall for $10 is too
expensive, in fact it is $10 more than it is worth.

OTOH, dancalls try to speak something like AT-commands over serial
cable, which made their decoding pretty easy. And they include netmon
by default (just type *#9993#). 
Look at http://info.lantanet.cz/gsm/en_dancall_2711.html for complete
list. Phone contains sw modem and it was one of the best phones in the
market in its time.

You *need* setserial /dev/ttyS0 low_latency in order for dancall
support to work.

* Known Bugs *

Dancall support is disabled in gnokii 0.5. Proper support will require
some statemachine changes which will be done after 0.5.

* To-do *

Revive it in full glory ;-)
