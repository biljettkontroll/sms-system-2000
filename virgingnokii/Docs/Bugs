Before reporting a problem with gnokii make sure that:
  * it isn't a known problem (use a search engine)
  * it still exists in the current development version
  * you can explain how to reproduce it 

Your report will be useless without the following information:
  * phone model and how do you connect (Bluetooth/IrDa/cable with its
    type)
  * the values of the configuration parameters model, connection and port
  * which program you are using (gnokii, xgnokii, smsd) and its version
  * (gnokii --version or smsd --version) along with source for it: git,
    tarball, binary package
  * edit your gnokiirc and enable debugging (see below) and attach gzipped
    output to the email: 

      $ LC_MESSAGES=en_US.UTF8 gnokii {parameters} >errfile 2>&1
      (with LC_MESSAGE=en_US.UTF8 the program output and the error messages
      will be in English) 

  * if you get a SEGFAULT, a backtrace is needed (refer to
    http://wiki.gnokii.org/index.php/Segfault)
  * if you get encoding errors always use the git version
  * if you are using a Nokia do your tests also with the fake driver
  * if you get communication errors, kernel version (and libusb version
    when using connection = dku2libusb) 

Send resulting report to gnokii-users (at) nongnu.org

If you want to debug yourself, use the git version and run autogen.sh (or
configure) with --disable-shared to build statically linked versions that
are easier to deal with, in this case the executables can be run as:

gnokii/gnokii
xgnokii/xgnokii
smsd/smsd

Debug routines are compiled in by default and can be enabled in the
[logging] section of the configuration file.  To enable the debug output for
the drivers and for gnokii, set debug = on. To enable the debug output for
higer level routines of smsd and xgnokii, set xdebug = on.

  [logging]
  debug = on
  xdebug = on
