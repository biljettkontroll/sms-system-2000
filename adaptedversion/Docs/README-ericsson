A1018s
======

* Communicates with AT commands, with few possible extensions like
pressing keys (AT+CKPD="X", x is 0..9, # * < > s==yes, e==no, c==clr).

* Contains AVR RISC cpu, and its internals are pretty well known (see
http://www.subdimension.com/community/scitech/ga628/a1018.htm), people
are writing their own firmware with arkanoid, for example.

* Its quite easy to flash firmware there.

* Works with gnokii, use model AT as hardware type and add
serial_baudrate = 9600 option to make it work.

AT+CREG=2 should give cellid and operator notifications.
AT+CPAS=1 gives "phone activity status" (what's that?)
AT+CFUN=0 turns phone off
AT+CIND=? gives some status, but I can't set indicators.
AT+CMEE=2 gives string errors, might be usefull for debugging?
AT+CCLK="02/04/26,22:20:10" works for setting time
