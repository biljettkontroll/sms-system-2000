README for MacOS X
==================

Status
The MacOS X port of Gnokii has successfully been tested on some phones.
I expect all phones supported by gnokii to work (famous last words...)

XGnokii, and others
The graphical X version, and the AT-emulator and virtual device compile
correctly with Darwin ports, but have not been thouroughly tested. If you
have any problems with these components of Gnokii, please report it to
the Gnokii mailing list.

Successfully tested hardware
USB to Serial adapters:
 - Keyspan USA-28Xb
 - Keyspan USA-19QW
 - BAFO technologies BF-810

Cables:
 - dlr3p
 - dau9p

Phones:
 - 3410
 - 6110
 - 6210
 - 6310

Please report any new hardware not in this list on the Gnokii mailing list
<gnokii-users@nongnu.org>

IrDA
The MacOS X version *does not* work with IrDA (and probably never will).
This is not a problem of Gnokii but a problem with Apple. The MacOS X IrDA
protocol stack is completely undocumented thus unusable. Unless they change
this or someone ports the IrDA stack from linux we're out of luck, sorry.

Contents of my config file:
port = /dev/cu.USA28X21P1.1
model = 6210
initlength = default
connection = dlr3p
#require_dcd = 1
use_locking = no

Notes:
Always set "use_locking = no" otherwise gnokii won't work.
USB to serial adapters always introduce two new device files in /dev per
serial port. Use the one starting with "cu.".

Installing with Darwin Ports 1.0
================================

The easiest way to install Gnokii on Mac OS X systems is to use the Darwin
Ports system. 

1) Download and install Darwin Ports by following the instructions at
   http://darwinports.opendarwin.org/getdp/

2) If you haven't already, execute "sudo port -d selfupdate" (without the
   quote marks)

3) To install all of Gnokii, including the graphical X version, type
   "sudo port install gnokii"
   without the quote marks. 

   To install the command line tool and the 
   AT-command emulator, type:
   "sudo port install gnokii +no_x11"
   without the quote marks. 

Compiling the command line tool and the AT-command emulator
===========================================================

These commands have been tested on Gnokii version 0.6.8, but should
also work on later versions, compiled on Mac OS X 10.4.2.

The preferred method of installing Gnokii is to use the Darwin Ports 
method described above.

1) Download the latest version of libtool from 
   http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/ (version 1.5.18 is fine). you
   will not need to install it, but we need a file from it.

2) Download the latest Gnokii distribution. (If you want to install from
   GIT, you should already know what you're doing, so you're on your
   own)

3) Extract both Gnokii and Libtool

4) copy ltmain.sh from the Libtool directory, replacing the version in 
   the config direcorty of the Gnokii distribution

5) in the gnokii directory, type:
   ./configure --disable-shared --disable-nls --without-x

6) type "make" (without the quote marks)

If after some time you now see
"##########################################
 ###
 ### It is strongly recommended to run:
 ### make install
 ### now. Otherwise gnokii may not work.
 ###
 ##########################################"

gnokii should be built OK
