README-WIN32
============

The graphical X version, the AT-emulator and virtual device are not ported to
Win32. This might change in the future but as far as I know no work is in
progress. Of course the effort of porting only makes sense if there is a need.
Do you have the need for extended Win32 functionality don't ask me but let us
all know on the gnokii mailing list.

Recent Windows-related information is updated on the gnokii wiki. The main
Windows page is: http://wiki.gnokii.org/index.php/Windows


Compile using Microsoft Visual Studio 2005
==========================================

Below a description how to compile gnokii with the Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 C/C++.

Both the commercial MSVS 2005 or MS Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition do work.

1) Extract gnokii source into <path>
2) (optional) Build settings are in <path>\win32\MSVS2005\config.h you may edit that.
3) Open <path>\win32\MSVS2005\gnokii.sln and compile :)

The solution will contain three projects: gnokii.dll, gnokii.exe and setup.
The setup build will fail on Visual C++ Express edition as the setup tools are
available only in the commercial Visual Studio.

You may want to change the compiler run-time library settings to single
threaded / debug single threaded to have much smaller binaries.


Compile using Microsoft Visual C++ 4.2 and 6.0
==============================================

Current versions do not compile.

Maintainers chose not to support these compilers. Microsoft don't support
those either. There are free of charge alternatives available from Microsoft.


Compile with Cygwin (B20)
=========================

Current versions do not compile.

This is on a TODO list and will be supported on later versions.


Cross compiling with MinGW
==========================

Current versions do not compile.

This is on a TODO list and will be supported on later versions.


Configuring gnokii
==================

Current versions attempt to read the config file from:

   1. Application installation directory: %APPDATA%\gnokii\config
   2. User's home directory: %HOMEDRIVE%\%HOMEPATH%\_gnokiirc
   3. Windows installation directory: %SYSTEMROOT%\gnokiirc

First being found (the lookup order is as above) is used.

Three values are required in the config file for gnokii to work: port, model
and connection. See the comments in the config file for further information.

In Windows the port is always a Com-port, a hard wired or virtual.
See the README-files for correct phone model number. See the README-files for
correct connection cable type.

Example:
port = com5:
model = 6510
connection = dlr3p

gnokii wiki has example configurations for various handsets at
http://wiki.gnokii.org/index.php/Config


IrDA support for Windows
========================

gnokii does support IrDA connection on Windows system. The support is built
in as default.

You will need Nokia IrDA driver for this to work, it is in Nokia PC Suite software
package. The driver will create a virtual Com-port when phone is near the PC.

If you want to disable the IrDA do the following:
1) Disable IrDA support in config.h file (see above) by replacing a line:
#define HAVE_IRDA 1
with
#undef HAVE_IRDA
2) Build gnokii as described above


Bluetooth support for Windows
=============================

gnokii does support Bluetooth connection on Windows system. The support is built
in as default.

If you want to disable the Bluetooth do the following:
1) Disable Bluetooth support in config.h file (see above) by replacing a line:
#define HAVE_BLUETOOTH 1
with
#undef HAVE_BLUETOOTH
2) Build gnokii as described above
