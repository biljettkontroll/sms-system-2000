All Nokia Series40 phones should work with this driver.

Code for the 6510 phones has been tested with DAU-9P and DLR-3P cables and
IrDA connection. The following conection type values are recommended for the
various connection media:

-----------------------------------------
| Media		| Connection type	|
|---------------------------------------|
| dau9p		| dau9p or serial	|
| dlr3p		| dlr3p			|
| IrDA		| irda			|
| Bluetooth	| bluetooth		|
-----------------------------------------
When you don't know what your cable is you can first try serial value.

The current code is able to:
 * identify the phone ;-)
 * read/write phonebook entries
 * read SMS messages of all kinds
 * read SMS centers
 * send basic text messages
 * read/write calendar entries
 * read the memory status
 * read/write bitmaps (group, operator logos)
 * read network info
 * read RF/battery level
 * read date/time
 * read list of ringtones
 * read/write profiles
 * read WAP bookmarks/settings
 * read/write/delete ToDo entries
 * create/delete SMS folders
 * save SMS messages to phone (may be dangerous)
 * read/delete MMS (only Series 40 3rd Edition)

Hint: For all these phones you can also use AT driver, as they all have a
builtin hardware modem, but it usually supports less commands so it isn't
recommended.

* TODO *

 * implement further functionality
