Before reporting a problem with gnokii make sure that problem still exists
with current gnokii release (refer to http://www.gnokii.org/ to find out the
most recent version) or even with current GIT version. If gnokii version
provided by your distribution please contact the package maintainer to
upgrade it.

When you report some problems with gnokii please attach the following
information:
 - phone model
 - connection type (irda/cable with its type)
 - gnokii version (gnokii --version) along with source for it: git,
tarball, binary package
 - edit you gnokiirc and enable debugging, e.g.:
    [logging]
    debug = on
   and attach gzipped output to the email:
    gnokii [parameters] 2>errfile
   replace your gnokii with the app you have problems with'

It would be good if you name the problem in the subject if possible and name
if it meets gnokii, xgnokii, gnokiid, smsd or some other app binaries or
gnokii as a whole.

It's always good to attempt to narrow the problem. E.g. if you have problems
with reading phonebook in xgnokii or gnocky, try gnokii CLI. If it works,
it's xgnokii/gnocky problem. If not, most likely it's library problem.

Send resulting report to gnokii-users@nongnu.org.

If you want to debug yourself, by default the GIT version adds -g to CFLAGS
when generating Makefile and the defines needed to print debug messages when
generating include/config.h then in your gnokiirc set debug=on to see
messages about libgnokii or gnokii and xdebug=on to see messages about
xgnokii or smsd.
