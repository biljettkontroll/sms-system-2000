-- Notes, bugs and a todo list for the 2110 series --

* Notes *

Code for the 2110 phones has been tested with home-built cable. It
should work well with any sort of cable.

* Known Bugs *

- Nokia protocol is not followed. We use hacks instead of collision
  detection protocol nokia suggests.

- Many. Look at code, needs cleanup, etc. Contact pavel at ucw dot cz
  if you want to help.

- When periodically fetching messages, it gets to state where protocol
  breaks with "bad checksum".

* To-do *

- SMS sending.

- Implement functionanlity such as reading internal A/D convertors and
  ability to turn on netmon. [Not sure if all 2110s even have netmon.]
