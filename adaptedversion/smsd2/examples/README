This is a collection of example "action" scripts for smsd. Some of them need
more software in addition to a valid smsd install.
See "THE FILE MODULE" section in "man smsd" for details on how to configure
smsd to use such scripts.

You can do your tests without paying for SMS by directly running action files
passing the phone number as first argument, the date as second argument and
passing SMS body as stdin:
 $ cat file_with_sms_body | action +123456 "$(date +"%y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")"


=== smsd2espeak ===

  Depends on: bash, espeak

  Description: speak the sender number, the date and the SMS text using
  espeak, trying to guess your language by using the LANG environment
  variable. Note that in this example the SMS is lost after it is spoken
  once. The espeak executable is called 3 times to follow the structure
  of the default action file provided with smsd.


=== smsd2notify ===

  Depends on: python-notify

  Description: show the SMS in a notification bubble using libnotify. Note
  that in this example the SMS is lost after it is shown once.


=== smsd2tomboy ===

  Depends on: python, tomboy

  Description: create a note in Tomboy when an SMS is received. Multiple
  messages from the same sender are appended to the same note. Url in the
  text are automatically hyperlinked by Tomboy. Note that in this example
  every SMS is automatically saved.
